# LearnCPP Project

This repository contains C++ code and exercises inspired by [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), a comprehensive resource for learning modern C++ programming.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ThomasCaneday/learncpp.git
    cd learncpp
    ```

2. **Build and run:**
    - Use your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, or Visual Studio).
    - Example:
      ```sh
      g++ -std=c++17 -o main chapter/main.cpp
      ./main
      ```

## Structure

- Source code files organized by chapter or topic.
- Additional folders for testing C++ techniques.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## Topics Covered

- Basic syntax and variables
- Control flow (if, switch, loops)
- Functions and recursion
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)
- Templates and STL
- File I/O
- Advanced C++ features

## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests for new exercises, improvements, or corrections. Anything and everything helps me learn the language.
